First Codesmith Hackathon

Ideas for Cool Google Chrome Extension:
    1. Evil extension: open random tabs, place random dot somewhere in one of those opened pages. Play a sound until the dot is clicked
    2. When you click on something, the cursor randomizes into random things
    3. Everytime we open a new tab, it plays noise and plays a different noise when you close 
    4. Sticky notes inside browser??
    5. Something funny with API information
    6.
    7.

    Current Direction: Combining 3 and 4, sticky notes app that plays funny noise
